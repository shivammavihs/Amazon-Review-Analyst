    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This is web application built and hosted using Streamlit, that provides users with product analytics by simply inputting the URL of product they are interested in purchasing. This includes information such as the number and type of ratings, as well as the number of reviews. Additionally, a backend ML model performs sentiment analysis on the reviews, providing users with a suggestion on whether or not to purchase the product based on the number of positive, negative, and mixed reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step-1: You need to get the `URL` of the product inorder to do an analysis before buying it. You can simply get the URL of the product by openiing the product in browser and copying the URL from URL bar.\n",
    "##### Step-2: Open this link: [Amazon Review Analyst](https://shivammavihs-amazon-review-analyst-app-611ipf.streamlit.app/)\n",
    "##### Step-3: Paste the product URL into the `Enter the product URL` field and press `Enter` or click on `Submit` button. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Product URL Field](assets/Markdown_Images/Product_url_bar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step-4: If your product URL is valid and the product is available on `Amazon India` then the product image and name will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Product Image and Name](assets/Markdown_Images/Product_name.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### And after that if there are ratings and reviews available for the product then the number of `Star ratings` will be displayed in the form of a `Doughnut Pie Chart` and below that average rating of the product and total number of ratings and reviews will bee displayed. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Piechart](assets/Markdown_Images/piechart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step-5: In order to initiate the `Sentiment Analysis` process, you are required to make a selection between analyzing all available reviews or solely those from the most recent `N pages`. It is important to note that selecting the option to analyze all reviews may result in a lengthier data retrieval process. Following your selection, kindly proceed by clicking the designated `Proceed` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Radio Options](assets/Markdown_Images/radio_options.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step-6: Upon choosing the `First` option, the system shall initiate a process to fetch the reviews from all accessible pages. However, upon selecting the `Second` option, the user will be prompted to indicate the desired latest `Number of Pages` for review acquisition and subsequent sentiment analysis. If the total count of pages falls below or equals to five, the system shall automatically obtain all reviews available for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Input the desired `Number of Pages` from which reviews are to be retrieved, and subsequently, select the `Continue` button to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Number of Pages](assets/Markdown_Images/number_of_pages.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The system will start fetching product reviews and provide visual feedback on the progress through a `progress bar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Progress bar](assets/Markdown_Images/progress.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Upon retrieving all the reviews, an automated sentiment analysis will be executed, subsequently presenting the quantity of reviews categorized as `Positive`, `Negative`, and `Mixed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### After evaluating the quantity of reviews reflecting various sentiments, a recommendation shall be generated as to whether the purchase of said item should be deemed advisable or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### You can find `Positive`, `Negative`, and `Mixed` reviews separated into their respective `dropdowns` below.\n",
    "\n",
